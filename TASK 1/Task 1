The scan found 4 hosts.
- 10.102.59.2 has 2 open ports, SSH (22) and TELNET (23)
- 10.102.59.12 has all ports in ignored states. Most likely, there is a firewall set up on the ports.
- 10.102.59.59 has one port is open, 7680, running Pando-Pub
- 10.102.59.64 also hash all ports in ignored states.

Now that I have information on the open ports, I can perform service-based enumeration (using flags like -A, -sV, -sO) to get the version of the services running.

Questions

1. What is an open port?
An open port is a network port that is actively accepting connections and running a service (e.g., HTTP on port 80, SSH on port 22).

2. How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?
Nmap sends a SYN packet to the target port.
  If it receives a SYN-ACK, the port is open.
  If it receives an RST, the port is closed.
It does not complete the handshake (half-open scan), making it stealthier.

3. What risks are associated with open ports?
Open ports expose services that may have vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to exploit, gain access, or launch attacks.

4. Explain the difference between TCP and UDP scanning.
TCP scanning checks ports using the TCP handshake and is more reliable.
UDP scanning sends UDP packets and waits for responses; it’s slower and less reliable because UDP is a connectionless protocol.

5. How can open ports be secured?
Closing unused ports, using firewalls, implementing strong authentication, keeping services up to date, and using intrusion detection systems.

6. What is a firewall's role regarding ports?
A firewall filters incoming and outgoing traffic, allowing or blocking traffic based on port numbers and rules.

7. What is a port scan, and why do attackers perform it?
A port scan is a technique to identify open ports and services on a system. Attackers use it to find entry points for exploitation.

8. How does Wireshark complement port scanning?
Wireshark captures and analyses network traffic, helping verify scan results and detect suspicious scanning activity.
